# BTEC - Breast Tissue Epigenetic Clock

Code accompanying the paper:

**"A breast tissue-specific epigenetic clock provides accurate chronological age predictions and reveals de-correlation of age and DNA methylation in tumor-adjacent and tumor samples"** by Garma et al.

This repository contais the code to train breast tissue-specific epigenetic clocksâ€”models that predict chronological age from DNA methylation data using ElasticNet regression. Two normalization methods are supported: BMIQ and SeSAMe.
